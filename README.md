## Install Environments

Create a new conda environment and install required packages.

```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n cvprw python=3.10

# Activate the environment
conda activate cvprw

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

⚙️ Note: Experiments are conducted on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 (24GB).
It is recommended to use the same GPU and package versions for best reproducibility. 



##  Prepare Datasets
Unzip the dataset file to the following directory:
```bash
./mvtec_ad_2
```
The structure of the current working directory should be as follows:
```bash
ISVL
├── beit
├── data
├── mvtec_ad_2
│   ├── can
│   ├── fabric
│   ├── ...
```

# Reproduce the result
```bash
bash run_vand.sh
```
The final submission result is the `results.tar.gz` file located in the current directory.
